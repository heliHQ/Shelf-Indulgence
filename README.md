# Shelf-Indulgence
Shelf-Indulgence is a simplified GoodReads for my TBR (to be read) list. To put it simply it is an online bookshelf with interactive shelves and the ability to organize books into different
categories (Read, In Progress, and Done). The site also takes you directly to GoodReads to read a synopsis of the book if you click on the book cover. Hovering over the book cover reveals the name and title.
